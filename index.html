    <h1>welcome to my world</h1>
    <p>
      Viper is a brilliant scientist coming from the United States. She is the
      second member of the VALORANT Protocol, joining along with Brimstone.
      While once a brilliant scientist, she no longer thinks clearly, having
      become hateful and biased in her tests. Her personality reflects this
      through the passive-aggressiveness present in all her interactions and the
      resentment she feels towards others. Almost every Agent, at some point or
      the other, comments on her hate-driven mind. Despite this she is able to
      express appreciation, being willing to congratulate those who have
      impressed her. Viper's abilities are based on self-made concoctions,
      comprising of toxicants which cause rapid respiratory damage when inhaled.
      These chemicals, which she manufactures herself, can be released into the
      air through specialized emitters to create small 'clouds' of the toxic
      gas. The smoke will eventually dissipate in air if left for long enough,
      and so the emitter must constantly remain active to retain the smoke's
      integrity.
