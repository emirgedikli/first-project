        When referring to her abilities, Viper refers to toxic chemicals as
        "toxins". Technically, this is a misnomer, as the term "Toxin" refers to
        harmful biological compounds that can be found in nature and are
        produced by living organisms. For artificially manufactured products
        with similar properties, the term "Toxicant" should be used. However,
        due to his advanced scientific training, Viper probably knows this, but
        nevertheless calls the poison a "toxin". This implies that the chemicals
        are, at least in part, derived from natural poisons (this is
        speculation, not canon). Viper's most distinguishing characteristic is
        its dark past. At one point in the past, Viper was a brilliant chemist,
        in a position of esteem due to her great mind. According to her file
        published by Fade, Viper has also received numerous awards (including
        the R. Francis Award and the Danton Award for outstanding innovation).
        According to an Omen voice line, she specializes in medicine and healing
        in one form or another. "Think about it, Sabine...you used to heal with
        your talent. It's funny." - Omen
